//! Buffered TCP Reader for continuous signal data collection
//!
//! This module provides a BufferedTCPReader that automatically buffers TCP logger data
//! in the background using a lightweight time-series database approach. It leverages
//! the existing TCPLoggerStream infrastructure while providing efficient time-windowed
//! queries for synchronized data collection during SPM experiments.

// TODO: For 2kHz sampling, consider replacing with:
// use crossbeam::queue::ArrayQueue; // Lock-free ring buffer
// use parking_lot::RwLock;          // Faster reader-writer lock

/// Buffered TCP reader that continuously collects timestamped signal data
///
/// This component creates a background thread that reads lightweight SignalFrame data
/// from TCPLoggerStream's channel and buffers it with high-resolution timestamps in a
/// circular buffer. It provides time-windowed query methods for retrieving data before,
/// during, and after specific time periods.
///
/// # High-Frequency Performance (2kHz+)
/// **IMPORTANT**: At sampling rates above 1kHz, lock contention becomes critical:
/// - Current implementation uses `Mutex<VecDeque>` suitable for <1kHz
/// - For 2kHz+, consider `crossbeam::queue::ArrayQueue` (lock-free)
/// - Alternative: `parking_lot::RwLock` for multiple concurrent readers
/// - Query methods must complete in <0.1ms to avoid data loss
///
/// # Memory Efficiency
/// Works with lightweight SignalFrame structures (just counter + data) throughout the
/// entire pipeline, avoiding the overhead of full TCPLoggerData per frame.
///
/// # Architecture
/// - TCPLoggerStream converts protocol data to SignalFrame (protocol â†’ lightweight conversion)
/// - BufferedTCPReader adds timestamps to SignalFrame (timing layer)
/// - Thread-safe time-windowed queries while continuous collection runs in background
