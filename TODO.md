## General
1. Implement script for multiple different tip prep cycle testing

  1. Create Action Destroy Tip to be able to run

3. Check if bias voltage bounds are positive To not mess up polarity

4. Reset the list of signals to make TCP channels work

## Testing

1. Implement scripts to interpret experiment logs

## Logger Injection

1. Make it possible to inject Action Results without having to run an action for edge cases.

1. Check if the use of SignalIndex from nanonis-rs is really needed.
